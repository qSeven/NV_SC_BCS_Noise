Few important scripts:
1) Script to solve gap equation self consistently
2) Library for noise functions
3) Scripts to calculate relaxation rates
4) Plots for figures:
    - Figure 1: R_1 v.s. temperature: T1_enhancement_vs_T_abs.py and plot_t1_enhancement.py 
    - Figure 3: R_J v.s. temperature and frequency
    - Figure 4: R_1 v.s. height
