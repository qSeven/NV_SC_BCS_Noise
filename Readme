Few important scripts:
1) Script to solve gap equation self consistently: Gap Data/solve_gap_eq_updated.py
2) Library for noise functions: bcs_noise_functions.py
3) Scripts to calculate relaxation rates: (in main directory)
4) Plots for figures(in Ploting Directory):
    - Figure 1: R_1 v.s. temperature  
    - Figure 3: R_J v.s. temperature and frequency 
    - Figure 4: R_1 v.s. height
